A Search scheduler
------------------

Configure Searches to periodically run against a variety of data sources. You can define a custom pipeline of Filters to manipulate any generated Alerts and forward them to multiple Targets.


An alert management interface

Review and manage Alerts through the web interface. You can apply Renderers to alerts to enrich them with additional metadata.


Use cases
=========

- You want to detect when certain log lines show up in ES.

- You want to manage alerts through a simple workflow.
And much more!
