Groups
======

Groups let you set up collections of users. You can assign Alerts to these collections and any email Alerts will go to all members of the group.

Configuring a group is quite simple, as they only have two fields:

- Type: The group type to use. This affects how email notifications are sent out to members of the group.
    - All: Email notifications should go to all members
    - Rotation: Email notifications be sent in a round-robin manner.
- Targets: A list of users in the group. (This field shows up once you've created the group)
